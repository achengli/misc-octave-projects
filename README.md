# Signal processing functions

This repository has the purpose to be a container of useful Octave functions for
signal processing.

## What does the package support?

By the moment the project has only few functions.
I always prefer to contribute an existing package unless to create one from new.
There is a project called octave-signal which is hosted on SourceForge.
I will send a pull request to the official repository when I get the code debugged.

## Can I contribute?

Of course, and please do not ask your self this anymore... All the projects that
are open to the public should have the goal to be useful and be forthcoming for
incoming improvements, otherwise it's a toxic project and I recommend you do not
participate in those projects.

## Samples

This is a plot using **randtones** function which is on /inst/ directory.
